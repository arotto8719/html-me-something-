    <h2>Food and Downton Abbey</h2>
   <p>Despite my career change involving Launchcode, I will always have an interest with history.  Downton Abbey is a great eaxmple of historical fiction.  
      Our family has been obsessed with this British Drama when we started watching it during the airing of season 2.  I also recently went with family and 
      friends to the opening night of the movie.  My love for British cooking also started because of Downton Abbey.  Most of the dishes in the show, for 
      upstairs and downstairs, you can make at home and are delicious.  Please note that I am not taking credit for any of these recipes.
      I used the recipes from the  unoffical cookbook to make these dishes and these can be found in the Downton Abbey Cookbook or online.  
      I would love to share what could be made easily with simple, everyday ingredients. 
      Here are my favorite British foods to make that were inspired by Downton Abbey.</p>

      Kedegree: This breakfast dish with fish, eggs, and rice that was influenced during the period of British Colonization of India.  It is seen in the pilot 
      episode and the first British Food the audience is introduced to in the show.  We're already being shown the differences in the culture by what 
      they can eat for breakfast.  Here, I've remade this dish eariler this year (but probably should have chopped the eggs and onions a little smaller).

      Cream of Mushroom Soup:  There are easier ways to make this dish than what is seen in the cookbook.  But I used it to make this soup for Easter dinner
      one year.

      Creamy Russet Leek Soup:  This is good meal for the upstairs residents or the servants living downstairs.  The recipe leaves the veggietables in their
      simple form but you can already blend it and add milk or cream before serving.

      Mrs. Patmore's Dropped Roasted Chicken:  Fans will remember this recipe in the episode where Mrs. Patmore made her "salty" raspberry pudding(I'd use
      that recipe for this list but there are too many ways).  She also dropped on of the roasts chickens on the floor, hence the name.  I also first made 
      this for that same Easter dinner and it's a regular for special occassions.

      Shepard's Pie:  It's basically ground meat, veggies, and potatoes.  It's a basic old world casserole dish you can throw into the oven.

      Yorkshire Puddings: This can be savory or sweet.  The main way to cook this is to cook the batter in meat drippings (from cooking a pot roast) in a
      muffin tin.

      Crepes Suzette: From the season 2 opener.  Thin pancakes for dessert
      <img>
      British Battenburg Cake: From Easter this year.  Battenburg's It's store-bought but a lovely picture.  It's also delcious!
      <img>
      Treacle Tart: Also a favorite from the Harry Potter Series.

    <h1>My Food Critic hogging the kitchen floor everytime I cook something.  She looks regal in this picture but she's acutally begging for 
        something to be dropped on the floor.</h1>
