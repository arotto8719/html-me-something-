    <h2>Food and Downton Abbey</h2>
   <p>Despite my career change involving Launchcode, I will always have an interest with history.  Downton Abbey is a great eaxmple of historical fiction.  
      Our family has been obsessed with this British Drama when we started watching it during the airing of season 2.  I also recently went with family and 
      friends to the opening night of the movie, which was the epilogue I did not know we needed.  My love for British cooking also started because of Downton Abbey.  
      Most of the dishes in the show, for upstairs and downstairs, you can make at home and are delicious.  Please note that I am not taking credit for any of these recipes.
      I used the recipes from The Unoffical Downton Abbey Cookbook to make these dishes and similar recipes can be found online.  
      The Official Cookbook was released during the release of the movie.  I plan to read it in the future.
      I would love to share what could be made easily with simple, everyday ingredients. 
      Here are my favorite British foods to make that were inspired by Downton Abbey.</p>
    <br>

      Kedegree: This breakfast dish with fish, eggs, and rice that was influenced during the period of British Colonization of India.  It is seen in the pilot 
      episode and the first British Food the audience is introduced to in the show.  We're already being shown the differences in the culture by what 
      they can eat for breakfast.  Here, I've remade this dish eariler this year (but probably should have chopped the eggs and onions a little smaller).

      Cream of Mushroom Soup:  There are easier ways to make this dish than what is seen in the cookbook.  But I used it to make this soup for Easter dinner
      one year.

      Creamy Russet Leek Soup:  This is good meal for the upstairs residents or the servants living downstairs.  The recipe leaves the vegetables in their
      simple form but you can already blend it and add milk or cream before serving.  This is a staple I usually eat when 
      I have plenty of potatoes or leek broth in the the kitchen.
      </p>
     <br>
      <img src =../images/chicken.JPG/>
      Mrs. Patmore's Dropped Roasted Chicken:  Fans will remember this recipe in the episode where Mrs. Patmore made her "salty" raspberry pudding(I'd use
      that recipe for this list but there are too many ways).  She also dropped one of the roasts chickens on the floor, hence the name.  I also first made 
      this for that same Easter dinner and it's a regular for special occassions.
   </p>

      Shepard's Pie: It's basically ground meat, veggies, and potatoes.  It's an old world casserole dish you can throw into the oven.
   </p>

      <img src = https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/food/ic/food_16x9_832/recipes/yorkshire_puddings_61798_16x9.jpg>
      Yorkshire Puddings: This can be savory or sweet.  The main way to cook this is to cook the batter in meat drippings (from cooking a pot roast) in a
      muffin tin.

      <img src = https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/sites/default/files/recipe_images/recipe-image-legacy-id--562458_11.jpg>
      Crepes Suzette: From the season 2 opener.  It's a famous French dessert of thin pancakes with a sugary Grand Mariner sauce.
      I've tried to make these once but crepes are very delicate to flip in the skillet.  This are one of the harder recipes
      on this list but it is easily remembered from the show.  The sauce has Grand Marnier, an orange-flavored, which you can purchase at any 
      store with a liquor aisle.
   </p>

      British Battenburg Cake: From Easter this year.  Battenburg's a delicous checkerboard sponge cake wrapped in apricot jam and almond paste.
      It's store-bought but a lovely picture.  It's also delicious!
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>

      Treacle Tart: This dessert is made with golden syrup and got it's name from the British slang word for "sweetheart". 
      It's also a favorite from the Harry Potter Series.

      Sybil's Ginger Nut Biscuits: My favorite blog recipe!  It's top ingredients are butter, golden syrup,
      and ginger.  In British food culture, they're called biscuits.  I made this recipe multiple times and I reccomend
      them to any cookie lover out there.
      </p>
      <br>
   <p><b>Honorable Mention:<b> 
      Chestnuts: Chestnuts can be roasted around Christmastime.  In the Unofficial Cookbook, there's a chestnut soup
      that you can blend and add cream to before serving.  I have yet to make this recipe but I have made chestnut rice(kurigohan) and a basic cupcake recipe
      (Mont Blanc Cupcakes) in the fall, which are recipes from Japan.
   </p>

      Jam Tarts: I made these eariler this year to get rid of some homemade strawberry jam in the freezer.
      You can find a nice recipe for jam tarts online.  You can have any kind of tart with a cup of tea.
   </p>

      Soupe a l'Oignon (French Onion Soup) with Madalines: I make French Onion Soup every New Year's Day.
      One year, I made them with Madeleines that were dipped in chocolate.  "Soupe a l' Oignon" is how it's
      mentioned in the unoffical cookbook and both recipes can found online with a reference to Downton Abbey. 
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      Meat Pies: Meat Pies and be easily be made at home for lunch or dinner.
